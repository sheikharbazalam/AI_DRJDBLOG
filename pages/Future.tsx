        My love endures like the everlasting fragrance I cherish, always lingering at the forefront of my senses. Love, to us, embodies the most beautiful of feelings—a culmination of our hard work and aspirations to meet our needs. It s never as easy as it seems; often, we must toil harder than imagined to navigate the complexities of relationships. Love sparks a curiosity within, igniting our willpower and infusing us with boundless energy. It brings happiness, a platform to share thoughts, emotions, and the rhythms of daily life with someone dearer than oneself—this, to me, is love. For me, my heart beats for Nurjaha, my beloved, Doctor Jibi Daniel. This marks the first time I have inscribed her name since my Masters Research Paper. Every effort, every moment of focus, adds to the beauty of our bond. Speaking of security, I acknowledge my absence and the times I may have faltered in supporting you during difficult moments. Yet, there is no possessiveness—only trust, unwavering and resilient. Trust in yourself, even through my eyes closed. Nurjaha, I love you deeply. Will you be mine forever?
